Solar Company Website – React Project

Welcome! This is a simple, clean, and fully responsive website I built for a fictional solar installation company using React. The goal of this project was to practice building modern frontend UIs, add some animation, and implement a working contact form using Web3Forms – all without a custom backend.

About This Project

I wanted to create something that looks like a real company website – something a recruiter or mentor could check out and say, “Okay, this person understands React basics and project structure.”

The site includes:

A homepage

Service section

Review/testimonial section

Call-to-action section

A contact form that actually works

All pages are built using React components and routed using React Router , clean frontend code and a real working form with Web3Forms.

Features

✅ Fully responsive design (mobile + desktop)

✅ React component-based architecture

✅ Routing with React Router

✅ Mobile hamburger menu navigation

✅ Live contact form using Web3Forms API

✅ Clean, simple CSS styling
